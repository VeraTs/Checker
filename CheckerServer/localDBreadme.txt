ABOUT CONNECTING TO LOCAL DB:
the mdf file sits at DataBase
DO NOT change the connecting string,
only the area regarding the path to it, if you must.

In case of error with localDB like connecting to it, 
easiest is to delete it, and create a new one,
by choosing New Connection > MDF file > enter name and location, 
for identification stay with default
